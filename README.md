### Power Learn Project - Software Engineering Scholarship Week 3 Assignment
Overview
This repository contains the solution for the Power Learn Software Engineering Scholarship Week 3 Assignment. The project demonstrates the application of key software engineering principles and tools in Python, focusing on developing efficient and functional solutions to real-world challenges.

Objective
In this assignment, the goal is to Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.
